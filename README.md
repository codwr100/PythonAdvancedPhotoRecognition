# PythonAdvancedPhotoRecognition

I created a program to detect specific colors in specific positions in java.I augmented this code to move the computer mouse and click on a specific color in a specific position once found, and I tested this new code using piano tiles. My program was able to achieve a score of 1400 before the tiles moved to fast and the mouse was unable to move quick enough to the next tile.

Imports used:
import pyautogui
import keyboard
import random
import win32api, win32con


Features Include
Moves mouse cursor to that position and auto clicks
