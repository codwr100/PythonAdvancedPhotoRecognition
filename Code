//Code was ran and tested in piano tiles, to determine where to click and what color to click on I determined through playing the game that the color of tiles was black, so i set the rgb value to 0
//As for detecting what position needed to be clicked i ran these two pieces of code
import pyautogui
pyautogui.displayMousePosition();
//these two lines gave me x and y coordinates of where the mouse was pointed to and the rgb value it was pointed at.
//I set the mouse to the middle of each tile line and got this result
#Title 1 Position X:  330 Y:  795 RGB: ( 76,  79, 115)
#Title 2 Position X:  425 Y:  786 RGB: ( 77,  80, 115)
#Title 3 Position X:  556 Y:  785 RGB: ( 77,  80, 115)
#Title 4 Position X:  643 Y:  777 RGB: ( 81,  84, 116)
